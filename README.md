# Welcome to my Drug Discovery Model for Ovarian Cancer project! 
Here, I used my knowledge in Python, machine learning, and online resources to 
1. Collect data from a database
2. Computed descriptors to be used to compare molecules to each other
3. Clean and process the data to create a dataset
4. Build a machine learning model using Random Forest Regression
5. Find the most optimal model

This project was motivated by my experiences at GSK, where I worked as a scientist quantifying the purification of biopharmaceuticals. After seeing various drug candidates fail clinical trials,
I became inspired to revolutionize the Research and Development sector in pharma. Through machine learning and AI, I believe we can use data from
existing molecules to discover better, more reliable drug candidates. This project is my first step in realizing my goal of becoming a data scientist to improve drug discovery and health outcomes 
for patients all over the world.

I used online resources while working with my own database to help with this project:
